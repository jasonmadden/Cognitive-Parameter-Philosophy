# Comparing Cognitive Parameter Philosophy (CPP) to Existing Models

This document explains how **Cognitive Parameter Philosophy (CPP)** differs from existing models used to describe neurodivergent experiences—especially autism—and why CPP fills a gap left by the others.

---

## 1. Medical Model

**View:** Autism is a disorder to be diagnosed, managed, or treated.

* Focuses on deficits, symptoms, and correction
* Normalizes functioning against a clinical baseline

**CPP View:** Rejects this completely. It treats cognitive traits as parameters, not malfunctions.

---

## 2. Social Model of Disability

**View:** Disability is not inherent—it arises when society fails to accommodate differences.

* Advocates for inclusive environments
* Sees disability as external, not internal

**CPP View:** Acknowledges this in part—yes, mismatched environments create barriers—but doesn’t require one to identify as “disabled.” It reframes constraints as neutral and designable.

---

## 3. Neurodiversity Paradigm

**View:** Neurological differences are natural variations, not flaws.

* Centers identity and inclusion
* Embraced by advocacy communities

**CPP View:** Agrees on variation but stops short of identity framing. It sees labels as optional tools, not identity cores.

---

## 4. Double Empathy Problem (Damian Milton)

**View:** Autistic and non-autistic people struggle to understand each other due to mutual misalignment—not a lack of empathy in one side.

**CPP View:** Agrees. This aligns with CPP’s model of “interface mismatch,” where cognitive systems with different input/output schemas misfire in communication.

---

## 5. Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD)

**View:** ND individuals often feel extreme distress at perceived rejection.

**CPP View:** Reframes this as a signal resolution issue—caused by distorted or low-fidelity input, not emotional fragility.

---

## 6. Identity-First Language (e.g. "Autistic person")

**View:** Language should affirm neurodivergent identity, not separate it as pathology.

**CPP View:** Language is only useful if it improves clarity or access. CPP does not define the self by label—it treats labels as environmental access tools.

---

## 7. Critical Disability Theory

**View:** Disability is entangled with social power, norm enforcement, and exclusionary systems.

**CPP View:** Acknowledges structural critique but avoids ideological abstraction. CPP prefers pragmatic models over status politics.

---

## 8. Why CPP Was Needed

CPP fills a gap left by these models:

* **It is not identity-based.** It serves those who don’t want to join a group or perform a label.
* **It is not deficit-based.** It treats cognition as architecture, not pathology.
* **It is operational.** It gives self-aware individuals a way to design around their traits without internalizing diagnosis or disability narratives.
* **It supports collaboration.** Through Interfaced Collaboration (IC), it shows how to structure communication and teamwork for minds that need signal clarity, not emotional bonding.

CPP is for people who are fully aware of their configuration and want to work, connect, and build—without having to belong to or escape from anything.

It treats the mind like a system.
It treats the world like an interface.
And it treats difference like something to tune—not fix, explain, or defend.
