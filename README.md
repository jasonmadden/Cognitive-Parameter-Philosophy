# Cognitive Parameter Philosophy (CPP)

CPP is a living framework for thinking about neurovariance without turning it into performance, pathology, or identity. It treats cognition as a system of parameters (e.g., bandwidth, latency, abstraction depth, input tolerance) that become visible when environments impose incompatible norms.

## Author Context

I’m a systems-oriented software founder with high-functioning autism (Level 1 ASD). But I don’t identify as disabled. I don’t perform my difference. I just manage it.

My mind works in deep abstraction, structured focus, and rapid pattern synthesis. I prefer clarity over signaling, depth over bonding, and function over affiliation.

I built this framework for people like me—those who:
- Think clearly but are mislabeled or misunderstood
- Reject labels unless they serve a purpose
- Optimize their own systems quietly, without needing group identity
- Want to work and collaborate—but need structure, not small talk

Cognitive Parameter Philosophy is a model for self-aware minds in an unstructured world. It’s not about pride or pathology. It’s about tuning your architecture and building systems that respect it.

## Start Here
- Core document: [CPP Core](philosophy/CPP-Core.md)
- Collaboration model (IC): [Interfaced Collaboration (IC)](philosophy/CPP-Core.md#8-structured-interconnection-interfaced-collaboration-ic)

## Who This Is For
- Individuals who experience cognition/environment mismatch and want language focused on function, constraints, and design.
- Builders of working systems (teams, managers, educators, operators) who want structured, low-friction collaboration patterns—especially async.
- Systems-thinkers who prefer parameter models over identity signaling.

## What This Isn’t
- A clinical/diagnostic model or medical guidance.
- A demand for any label, disclosure, or performance to justify needs.
- A community brand or ideology; it’s a framework you can use (or not) when it reduces friction.

## Key Concepts
- Parameter-based cognitive modeling (configuration over label)
- Constraint management (adjust systems, not people)
- Label minimalism (use labels only when they reduce friction)
- Social mismatch ≠ deficit (environment fit matters)
- Agency without performance (clarity, contracts, consistency)

## Status
This repo is intentionally small right now: the core document is the source of truth, and everything else is TBD.

## Planned Structure (TBD)
- `philosophy/`: Additional CPP theory documents
- `tooling/`: Templates for interaction contracts (IC)
- `diagrams/`: Visual models of parameters and mismatch
- `use-cases/`: Practical applications (tech, education, async teams)
